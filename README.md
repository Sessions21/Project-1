## User Story:
#### As a busy parent/guardian, I find it extremely difficult to plan a daily schedule that keeps track of the various personal and family appointments while factoring in all the variables that can affect travel time or contents needed due to weather, traffic, etc. I WANT a single scheduling site where I can gather all pertinent information, SO I CAN be more efficient with my scheduling, get to appointments on time, and have peace of mind knowing it is all organized in a single place.

## Our Solution: The SAHP Calendar

### Project Summary:
The SAHP Calendar provides a daily schedular that allows a user to enter the site each morning to setup their daily activities. A section is made available to add hourly appointments/tasks/events and save them to local storage for repeated viewing throughout the day. It also provides multiple sections for the user to gather pertinent information that may dictate changes to planning for the daily events.  For example, there is a section to get the latest weather forecast for the day and week. There is also a section to get the directions to the appointment which provides the travel time taking into account the current traffic conditions.  Overall, the site allows a user to get the full picture of what it will take to get to each event or appointment on time being appropriately prepared.

### The SAHP Calendar website includes the following features:
* A landing page with navigation to jump to various planning and scheduling sections.
* From said navigation, the "get forcast" button toggles a modal to set weather location preferences.
* There is an interactive daily scheduling calendar that allows hourly scheduling that persists throughout the day for intermintent viewing. In this section there is also an API call to momentJS to present the current time, and to display the urgency of the task as the designated time approaches.
* Daily weather can be updated live for current conditions with an API to Open Weather.
* We've also provided a map section which allows users to input destinations and return the navigational directions with the arrival time adjusted based on current traffic conditions.
* Lastly, we have proivded some links to contact the creators of the page and see the coding.
